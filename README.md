These notebooks are one of my courseworks, focusing on numerical modeling. The workflow begins with:

Project1_numerical_methods.ipynb

Project1_dedalus.ipynb

Project2_transport.ipynb

Project3_tsunami.ipynb

Project4_storms.ipynb

The study starts with the Explicit Euler method and the Crank-Nicholson method to explore solving partial differential equations (PDEs) using Dedalus. It then progresses to modeling a pollution diffusion and advection model, extends to shallow water modeling, and concludes with storm modeling, including the effects of the jet stream and a dumping term.
